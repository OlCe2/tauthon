For interactive sessions, fix several :file:`site.py` Readline-related
initialization problems, and have warnings printed when appropriate. Don't fail
if there is no global Readline init file. Don't fail with ad-hoc Readline
libraries. The history file is set up even if reading the default init files
failed.
