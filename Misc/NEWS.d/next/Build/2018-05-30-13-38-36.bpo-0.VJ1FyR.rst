Extensions where not properly compiled with PGO because the CFLAGS were not
read from the environment in "setup.py". Once that was fixed, gcc failed
with an internal compiler error (ICE) because the same source file was used
in 3 different extensions so it was compiled 3 different times in the
profile generation stage: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85759

After introducing the concept of mtime-conditional recompilation to
distutils, the ICE was avoided.

While building the software in a sandbox, on Gentoo, it became obvious that
the profiling task was accessing system-wide paths it had no business
accessing. This was also fixed.

A couple of regression tests fail randomly when the suite is run in
parallel, so we work around that by excluding them from the profiling task.

EXTRATESTOPTS is now used inside PROFILE_TASK, to allow for custom arguments
(like "-jN" to run N jobs in parallel).

We no longer let the profiling task fail silently.
